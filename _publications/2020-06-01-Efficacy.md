title: "The Efficacy of Collaborative Referencing Intervention in Chronic Aphasia: A Mixed-Methods Study"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-06-01-Efficacy
excerpt: 'The feasibility of a collaborative referencing intervention (CRI) for adults with chronic aphasia has been documented in two descriptive case studies (Devanga, 2014; Hengst et al., 2010, 2008). The current Phase II mixed-methods treatment study replicates the CRI with four additional participants (using interpretive research) and investigates how it impacts a traditional measure, participants&quot; confrontational naming abilities, outside of game play (using multiple-probe single-case experimental design).'
