Drawing on the power of social connections, group treatments have emerged to facilitate better generalization of language to everyday communication and improve life participation, while being cost-effective. We are designing novel group-based clinical interventions for acquired neurogenic communication disorders and investigating the power of university-based clinical programs that offer group treatments.

## Completed work:

### Design a pilot retrospective study to examine the types of outcome measures employed in the Aphasia Communication Enhancement program at WMU, and analyze their outcomes for participants with aphasia and their care partners

## Work in progress:

### Design and assess the feasibility of Group Collaborative Referencing Intrervention (CRI) for aphasia

### Funding:
Faculty Research and Creative Activities Award (FRACAA), Western Michigan University ($10,000) (2021-22). Title of the study: Feasibility of Group Collaborative Referencing Intervention for Aphasia. PI: Suma Devanga

## Targeted Goal:

Design and implement a university-based student-led aphasia group treatment study to analyze the clinical and functional outcomes
