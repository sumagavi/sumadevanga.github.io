While the aphasia literature documents treatment outcomes typically using standardized clinical tests, my research is focused on measuring the outcomes of clinical interventions by triangulation of findings from multiple measures such as patient-reports and novel discourse analysis methodologies.

## Completed work:

### Examine the role of hand gestures in studying the clinical outcomes for an individual with severe aphasia by developing a novel multimodal discourse analysis protocol

### Funding:
Support for Faculty Scholars Award (SFSA), Western Michigan University ($2,000) (2018-2019). PI: Suma Devanga

## Work in progress:

### Analyze the interactional displays of communication confidence in individuals with aphasia by situated discourse analysis and compare the findings with the patient-reports of perceived confidence.
